# simple-snake
This is a simple console(VT100) snake game

# OS
This game only works on Linux and (probably) other Unix-like systems
because it uses such libraries as `<termios.h>` and `<unistd.h>` to
manipulate terminal.

# How to compile?
You can use any compiler you want. Example compilation command:
```
gcc snake.c -o snake
```
